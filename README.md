# Purpose
This is my compedium of scripts I wrote in python. It was years ago when I should have thought about creating one place to store all my scripts, but you know what they say - better late then never.
So here it is - all python scripts I write not for any kind of project, but just to see how something works.

## Directories

*blind75* - scripts, answers to problems from leetcode blind 75
